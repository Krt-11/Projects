This file in python is something that I made for my linear algebra class as a personal project to give resources to other students. The program takes an input matrix and finds the reduced echelon form of the matrix. I use sumpy library to calculate the rref instead of donig the math within the code hopefully to save resources and for a faster output.

The code should run on any computer or laptop on command prompt for windows and terminal for laptops.
