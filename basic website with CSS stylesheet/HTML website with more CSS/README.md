This project is a very basic HTML file with a CSS stylesheet that I made to understand how CSS works and getting familiar with HTML tools available to developers that I can use in future projects. 

The functions and tools I have used in this code are very basic just to get an understanding of what each thing each tool and effect looks like. How animations works and understanding the libraries needed if ever.
